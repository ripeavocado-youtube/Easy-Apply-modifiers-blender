Tired of clicking Apply a hundred times like it’s your side job?
This addon adds a magical “Apply All Modifiers” button right above the “Add Modifier” menu.

✅ One click. Boom. All your modifiers applied in order.

✅ If you have no modifiers… well, it gently reminds you that you wasted a click.

✅ Zero bloat, maximum Blender laziness.

Installation

Smash that Download ZIP.

In Blender: Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → Install…

Select the ZIP and enable it.

Feel powerful.

Why?

Because Blender makes you apply modifiers one by one… and that’s just BORING.
